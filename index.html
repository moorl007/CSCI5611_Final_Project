        <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>I mentioned some suggestions I received from peers which I didn’t implement.  Specifically, I’m talking about introducing monsters to the game which would try to catch the user.  One thing I would have to change in order to implement this is to change the way the maze is generated.  With the current maze generation algorithm, if the user got stuck in a dead end, and a monster cornered the user, there would be no way for the user to escape because my algorithm doesn’t produce any loops in the maze.  There would have to be a good balance between the amount of loops in the maze and the number of dead ends, because if there are too many loops then the user would be able to make thier way to the bottom right of the maze pretty easy. 

                Another idea I received was to introduce a timer, or a counter of how many particles the user needed to use to complete the maze.  It would be fun to have a scoreboard of people who were able to complete a maze the fastest or with the least amount of particles.  This also gets tricky because the maze is different each time, so one user might have a really easy maze, and another user might have a really hard maze.
