        <h2>Final State</h2>

            <p>
                The goal of my project was to create a maze where all of the walls, floor, and ceiling were white, meaning the user could not see where they were.  In order to navigate the maze, the user would be able to shoot shoot black particles which will stick to the surfaces of the maze and they can use the arrow keys to navigate to the exit.  I also wanted to be able to generate a different maze each time so the user could have a new experience every time they played.  The user starts in the top-left corner of an orthogonal maze and can use the arrow keys and WASD keys to navigate.  The user can also press the space bar to shoot particles in the diection they are facing.  Once the user finds the exit, they realize that the maze was just a large room and the outside of the room is very beautiful.

                My final product turned out to be pretty close to what I had initially envisioned. Which is shown below:

        <h2>Algorithms and Approaches</h2>

            <h3>Maze Generation</h3>
                <p>
                    My first problem I needed to solve was randomly generating a maze.  I thought a good idea would be to have a 20 by 20 grid, and select some of those blocks to be walls, and allow the user walk and move in the spaces that weren’t walls.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="20by20.png" alt="A 20 by 20 grid which will be the basis of my maze" width = 500 height = 500>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    I will demonstrate further with an 8 by 8 grid. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Initially, every other row and every other column are filled in, meaning they are walls.  The user starts in the upper left corner of the grid, so that’s where our algorithm will start.  This initial cell has unvisited neighbors to the right and beneath it.  

                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="maze2.png" alt="An 8 by 8 grid where every other row and every other column are walls.  The starting cell is in the upper left, and it has a neighbor to the right and a neighbor beneath." width = 500 height = 500>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    The algorithm randomly selects one of these unvisited neighbors and removes the wall between itself and that neighbor.  
                </p>


                <figure>
                    <img src="maze3.png" alt="A wall between a random, unvisited neighbor is removed" width = 500 height = 500>
                    <figcaption>A wall between a random, unvisited neighbor is removed</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The algorithm performs the same actions until it reaches a state where it doesn’t have any unvisitied neighbors. 
                </p>
            
                <figure>
                    <img src="maze8.png" alt="A cell has been reached with no remaining unvisited neighbors.  The neighbor above, below, and to the right have all been visited." width = 500 height = 500>

                </figure>

                <p>

                    The algorithm then goes back to the last cell which did have unvisited neighbors and continues this process.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="maze9.png" alt="The algorithm goes back to the last cell it visited which still has unvisited neighbors" width = 500 height = 500>
                    <figcaption>The algorithm goes back to the last cell it visited which still has unvisited neighbors</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The algorithm keeps going until all of the cells don’t have any unvisited neighbors.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    Finally, I want to add an exit to the maze so I remove the right most cell on the bottom row which is connected to an open cell.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some examples of mazes generated from 20 by 20 grids are shown below:

            <h3>Particle Shooting</h3>
                <p>
                    Another problem I needed to resolve was particle shooting.  It was pretty easy to generate a particle from the user’s location and shoot in in the direction they were facing with a little randomness added.  However, in order to make the particle effective in helping the user navigate through the maze, they needed to stick to the walls, floor and ceiling.  The way I do this is by calculating the time it takes the particle to reach the nearest wall, the floor and the ceiling.  This gives three different numbers, and I return the smallest, non negative number.  This is because a negative number would mean the particle would have to travel in the opposite direction it is currently traveling, and the smallest positive number is the first furfase the particle crosses.  In each draw loop, I update how much longer each particle has left before it crosses its first collision point, and then I set the velocity of that particle to zero.  This gives the appearance that the particle is stuck where it is supposed to be.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="stick3.png" alt="Intuition behind how I get the particles to stick to the walls when they collide" width = 800 height = 450>
                    <figcaption>Intuition behind how I get the particles to stick to the walls when they collide</figcaption>
                </figure>

            <h3>User/Wall Collisions</h3>

                <p>
                    Initially, just like how the particles were able to travel through the walls of the maze, the user was also initially able to travel through the walls of the maze.  In order to prevent this, I determine if the user is close to a cell border.  If the two cells which make up the border are not actually wall cells, then the user can pass through as expected. 
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="cellEdgeNowall.png" alt="Boundary between two cells.  Neither are wall cells so the user can pass through." width = 800 height = 450>
                    <figcaption>Boundary between two cells.  Neither are wall cells so the user can pass through.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    However, if one of the cells which make up the border is in fact a wall, then I only update the user’s position along the same axis the wall is aligned with.  
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="cellEdge.png" alt="Boundar between two cells.  One of the cells is a wall so the user will not be able to pass through" width = 800 height = 450>
                    <figcaption>Boundar between two cells.  One of the cells is a wall so the user will not be able to pass through</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    This prevents the user from phasing through walls when they are walking at normal speed, but if the user pressed the shift key to move fast, then there is a chance that they will be able to pass through the wall because they are never in the zone in which the collision detection algorithm tests for.

                </p>
        
        <h2>Computational Bottlenecks</h2>

                <p>
                    The biggest limiting factor on my game was the number of particles I was able to render.  All of the particles need to be kept in memory and rendered every frame, even when they are not in the actual gameplay window.  Specifically each particle is made up of verteces, so if I could reduce the number of vertices of each particle, I could render more particles. 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Initially I was using Processing’s built in sphere function.  Processing allows me to set the detail level of the spheres, and the default was 30.  These spheres look how one would expect a sphere to look as shown below:
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="30sphere.png" alt="Result of using Processing’s sphere built in function with a detail level of 30" width = 500 height = 500>
                    <figcaption>Result of using Processing’s sphere built in function with a detail level of 30.  Can only render about 400 before dropping below 30FPS</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    However, I didn’t really care how spherical the particles actually were, so I decided to change the detail level of the spheres to 1 to see if I could render more before dropping in frames per second.  The detail 1 spheres are shown below.  
                </p>


                <figure>
                    <img src="1sphere.png" alt="Result of using Processing’s sphere built in function with a detail level of 1" width = 500 height = 500>
                    <figcaption>Result of using Processing’s sphere built in function with a detail level of 1.  Can render about 40,000 before dropping below 30 FPS</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    As you can see, these don’t look as much like spheres as the detail 30 spheres, but I was able to render about 40,000 spheres using detail level of 1 and only about 400 detail level 30 spheres before by frames per second dropped below 30.  I also decided to try processing’s box built in function.  The result of these particles is shown below:
                </p>


                <figure>
                    <img src="boxes.png" alt="Result of using processing’s box built in function." width = 500 height = 500>
                    <figcaption>Result of using processing’s box built in function. Can render about 25,000 before dropping below 30 fps</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    However, using this method resulted in being able to render 25,000 particles before dropping to 30 FPS.  The final method I attempted was to generate manual tetrahedrons which is the polyhedron with the least amount of vertices.  Using this method resulted in particles looking like this:
                </p>


                <figure>
                    <img src="tets.png" alt="Result of using my own, manually built tetrahedrons" width = 500 height = 500>
                    <figcaption>Result of using my own, manually built tetrahedrons.  Can render about 60,000 before dropping below 30 fps.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    This performed better than detail 1 spheres because I was able to render 60,000 particles before dropping below 30 FPS.  I didn’t care how the particles looked, so I decided to use the tetrahedrons as they were the most efficient.  The only thing I cared about was being able to render the maximum number of particles possible before having to delete the oldest ones to make space for the new ones.  
                </p>

        <h2>Feedback</h2>

        <p>
            I thought people’s responses to my proposal and mid-point review were that of intrigue.  I remember when I showed how the particles shoot out to reveal the maze people were pretty impressed.  During the mid-point review, some of the aspects which weren’t worked out yet, like the user/wall collision detection, so people pointed out that I needed to solve that issue.  This was an aspect which I was planning on doing anyway.  However, some of the responses gave me some good ideas.  One idea which I implemented was to have a good way to tell when the user reached the end of the maze.  I think the exact suggestion was to make the floor of the goal cell green or something.  I wanted to take it a step further and make the maze actually have an exit.  I could then make the outside world look nice by having a plane for grass, a blue sphere for the sky, and a yellow sphere for the sun.  
        </p>

        </figure>




        <p>
            I felt myself going a little crazy being inside a white room for a long time if I could solve the maze quickly, so when I got to the outside world it is pretty satisfying.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another suggestion I got was to make monsters chase you around the maze.  I wasn’t able to implement this in time for the end of the semester, but it was interesting to think about how I would've done it.  I think I would have made the monsters spheres, but I don’t know if they would be visible all the time, or if the user would need to spray particles to reveal them.  I think it would be cool to have to make the user spray particles to reveal them, and when the particles got stuck to the monsters, they would change from black to red.  This would probably add some scary moments to the game.
        </p>

        <h2>State of the Art</h2>

        <p>
            My game uses a particle system to reveal the walls of the maze to the user.   In their 2021 paper, Unified particle system for multiple-fluid flow and porous material, Bo Ren, Ben Xu, and Chenfeng Li describe using a particle system to simulate interactions between multiple fluids and porous materials.  The system is based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method and uses a novel virtual phase concept to avoid the need for explicit particle state tracking and runtime particle insertion/deletion.  The proposed model is flexible and stable enough to handle the complex interactions between multiple fluids and porous materials, and it can accurately represent the mass and momentum transport in the simulation space.  Where I use a particle system to aid navigation, state of the art particle systems can be a very useful tool in animation or simulation.

        <p>
            I try to keep my game interesting my regenerating a new maze each time using a random depth first search method.  In their 2020 paper, Generating Procedural Dungeons Using machine learning methods, Mariana Werneck and Esteban Clua propose a stratege for procedrually generating dungeons for video games using machine leaning techniques.  The aim is to create a more efficient and sustainable game development process by reducing costs and time through the use of procedural content generation.  The generated dungeons are intended to respect room positioning design choices and maintain the character of the game.  I found that when playing my game, there are some mazes which are quite easy to solve, and I wish they could be harder.  Part of this is because I use a random algorithm.  If I were able to train a model to generate a new maze each time,  I’m sure it would be able to make it more interesting than some of the mazes I generate with my random algorithm.

        </figure>

        <p>
            While I wasn’t able to implement any monsters which chased the user in the maze, I imagine that I would try to incorporate some kind PRM / A* algorithm to bring those monsters to the user.  In their 2022 paper, Enhancing Action Maze Video Games using Suffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), Dheeraj Gharde, N Suryanarayan, and V R Badri Prasad, propose using SFLA in action maze video games.  SFLA is a population-based meta heuristic algorithm developed in 2006.  SFLA is shown to to be an effective method to optimize the movements of in-game characters.

        </p>

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>I mentioned some suggestions I received from peers which I didn’t implement.  Specifically, I’m talking about introducing monsters to the game which would try to catch the user.  One thing I would have to change in order to implement this is to change the way the maze is generated.  With the current maze generation algorithm, if the user got stuck in a dead end, and a monster cornered the user, there would be no way for the user to escape because my algorithm doesn’t produce any loops in the maze.  There would have to be a good balance between the amount of loops in the maze and the number of dead ends, because if there are too many loops then the user would be able to make thier way to the bottom right of the maze pretty easy. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Another idea I received was to introduce a timer, or a counter of how many particles the user needed to use to complete the maze.  It would be fun to have a scoreboard of people who were able to complete a maze the fastest or with the least amount of particles.  This also gets tricky because the maze is different each time, so one user might have a really easy maze, and another user might have a really hard maze. 
                </p>
